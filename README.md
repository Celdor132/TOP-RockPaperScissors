This assignment came from The Odin Project. I have used a multitude of sources to design this game.

    As of November 26, 2022, this game is solely played in the console. For this version, so far, it has helped me:
            Understand scope, in terms of functions and variables.
            Use developer tools in Google Chrome
            Learn when to use comments
            Learn to call functions from other functions
            Learn when to take breaks when frusturated
            Use psuedocode to break down complex worlflow
    And many others are slipping my mind!

Later, I will add a User Interface to this game and make it a bit more fun to play.
